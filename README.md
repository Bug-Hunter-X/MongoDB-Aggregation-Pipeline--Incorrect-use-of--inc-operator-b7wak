# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect $inc Usage

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. The `$inc` operator is intended to increment a field's value within a document. However, using it in the aggregation pipeline incorrectly modifies the result of the aggregation itself, not the original documents in the collection.

## Bug Description:
The provided code snippet showcases an aggregation pipeline that incorrectly uses `$inc` to modify the `count` field.  This results in an incorrect count value after the pipeline's execution, potentially leading to skewed data analysis.

## Solution:
The correct approach involves using the `$inc` operator as part of an `$update` operation after performing the aggregation to modify the original document counts.
